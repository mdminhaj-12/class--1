            <p><i><B><font size="5">Chittagong<font/></B>The region of Chittagong is traditionally centred around its seaport which has existed since ancient
                 times. The region was home to the ancient independent Buddhist kingdoms of Samatata and Harikela.[1] It later fell under
                  of the rule of the Gupta Empire, the Pala Empire and the Arakanese kingdom of Waithali until the 7th century. Arab Muslims
                   traded with the port from as early as the 9th century. Historian Lama Taranath is of the view that the Buddhist king 
                   Gopichandra had his capital at Chittagong in the 10th century. According to Tibetan tradition, this century marked the 
                   birth of Tantric Buddhism in the region.[2] The region has been explored by numerous historic travellers, most notably 
                   Ibn Battuta of Morocco who visited in the 14th century. During this time, the region was conquered and incorporated into 
                   the independent Sonargaon Sultanate by Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah in 1340 AD.[3] Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah constructed a
                    highway from Chittagong to Chandpur and ordered the construction of many lavish mosques and tombs. After the defeat of 
                    the Sultan of Bengal Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah in the hands of Sher Shah Suri in 1538, the Arakanese Kingdom of Mrauk U 
                    managed to regain Chittagong. From this time onward, until its conquest by the Mughal Empire, the region was under the 
                    control of the Portuguese and the Magh pirates (a notorious name for Arakanese) for 128 years.[2]<Br>

                The Mughal commander Shaista Khan, his son Buzurg Umed Khan, and Farhad Khan, expelled the Arakanese from the area during the
                 Conquest of Chittagong in 1666 and established Mughal rule there. After the Arakanese expulsion, Islamabad, as the area came 
                 to be known, made great strides in economic progress. This can mainly be attributed to an efficient system of land-grants to 
                 selected diwans or faujdars to clear massive areas of hinterland and start cultivation. The Mughals, similar to the Afghans 
                 who came earlier, also built mosques having a rich contribution to the architecture in the area. What is called Chittagong 
                 today also began to have improved connections with the rest of Mughal Bengal. The city was occupied by Burmese troops shortly 
                 in First Anglo-Burmese War in 1824 and the British increasingly grew active in the region and it fell under the British Empire.
                  The people of Chittagong made several attempts to gain independence from the British, notably on 18 November 1857 when the 2nd,
                   3rd, and 4th companies of the 34th Bengal Infantry Regiment stationed at Chittagong rose in rebellion and released all the 
                   prisoners from jail but were suppressed by the Kuki scouts and the Sylhet Light Infantry (10th Gurkha Rifles).[2]<Br>
                
                Chittagong grew at the beginning of the twentieth century after the partition of Bengal and the creation of the province of 
                Eastern Bengal and Assam.[4] The construction of the Assam Bengal Railway to Chittagong facilitated further development of 
                economic growth in the city. However, revolutionaries and opposition movements grew during this time. Many people in 
                Chittagong supported Khilafat and Non-Cooperation movements<Br>
